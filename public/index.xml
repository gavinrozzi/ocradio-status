      <description>Resolved - We believe all users experiencing issues have been able to connect at this time. (May 25, 2018 - 05:54)Monitoring - We believe the connectivity issues are being caused by an isolated ISP issue. We&amp;rsquo;ve had reports that swapping to Google DNS servers (see here; https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using) resolves the problem for users. (May 25, 2018 - 04:40)Investigating - We&amp;rsquo;re aware of reports that users are experiencing connection issues on the East coast of the United States.</description>

      <description>Post-mortem
At approximately 14:01, a Redis instance acting as the primary for a highly-available cluster used by our API services was migrated automatically by Google’s Cloud Platform. This migration caused the node to incorrectly drop offline, forcing the cluster to rebalance and trigger known issues with the way our API instances handle Redis failover. After resolving this partial outage, unnoticed issues on other services caused a cascading failure through Example Chat App’s real time system.</description>
